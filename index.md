## Introduction

Where will become the next Atlantis? It is no suprise that with climate change the sea levels are rising. We are curious as to how much they will rise and where. Low coastal areas are in danger with sea level rise.

## Methods

To predict the future, we built upon our previous research paper (TODO), that used emulators in an effort to predict the world's climate (temperature, precipitation, ...). From there we used the (TODO) paper's findings to re-create predicting sea level rise.

## Results

We see rise.
