Welcome! We are a group of data science majors at the University of California, San Diego. We are passionate about climate change and worked with our mentor, Duncan Watson-Parris to create this project.

This repository contains the code necessary to create our website. It links to our code for the project and our research paper. You can learn more about us and explore sea level rise. Please enjoy!
